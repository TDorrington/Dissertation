Dissertation Notes
- introudction: dissertation on microcosm; what it is, why was it a good thing to have done. Re-use papers arguments
  about why this is a good way to help students debug type errors. Summary of what I did and how i evalauted it.
  Talk about no user study because paper did that. Short summary of how it worked it.
  
- preparation: add something about papers & books I read (fuzzing too). Built on Milton. Software engineering.
  Waterfall bollocks.
  
- implementation: high level view. For each individual piece, put what was hard. Find hard things I've done
  Move fuzzer implementation here
  
- evaluation: no user study and why.
  Graphs: group tests (tests on lists, big tests, small tests)
  Tests run vs tests spotted correctly
  To evaluate fuzzers, drop fuzzed expressions into existing ML type system
  
- conclusion: what i've learned, what went well, and what didnt go well, and what id do in the future
