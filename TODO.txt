Pattern wildcard - can the e1 expression fail to type?

what about matching an expression record and a pattern?
	- should it be mutually recursive with evaluate
	- can it only be variables & values?
	- what about a hole
	
in bottom case of evaluating a value, should i keep evaluating & resolving chain until
nothing changes?
make resolve chain return a boolean value, true iff it changed something

Do i even need a record value hole? Can it not be put into a record value?

is it okay to match types only in narrow?
